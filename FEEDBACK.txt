FEEDBACK:

Good sample demonstrating your implementation.


Nice clean implementation of your LazySearchTree class with lazy deletion!


other comments:
   Well done in going above and beyond in implementing removeHard() feature.
   However, the project description does not describe the implementation of 
   removeHard() feature. Nor does the provided test file check for this.

   Make sure to check that your implementation meets the requirements as 
   specified in the upcoming project.

-Bita.
